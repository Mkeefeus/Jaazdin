        "As your skills improve, you learn to modify your Shotgun. As your Gun Tier levels up, your weapon is upgraded into its next tier by paying for the upgrade cost and spending 1 hour using your Gunsmith's Tools. If you lose or need to replace your special firearm, you can spend 1 hour per Tier it was crafting a new one, and the combined gold cost."
