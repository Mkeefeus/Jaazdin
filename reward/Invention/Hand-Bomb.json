        "On a miss, the bomb lands at the feet of the targeted creature. The bomb will then detonate after the end of your next turn, or if the bomb would take radiant/force/fire/thunder damage before that point.",
        "The bomb can be picked up and thrown again in this time period, or diffused by making a DC 13 Tinkers Tools (INT/DEX) check. Failing this check immediately detonates the bomb."
